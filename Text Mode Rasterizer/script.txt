In time with arpeggio: TMDC8 appears
text then explodes into a bunch of triangles that slowly fade into darkness
3 3d quarter notes bouncing in time with the music then bounce onto the screen
the notes then swirl in a circle then shoot out towards the background
the camera quickly catches up
the background then fades into a plasma tunnel moving quickly (b&w plasma)
the plasma tunnel slowly grows bigger and more gold-colored until it suddenly ends
cut to an outside view of a saxophone with the notes flying out and passing in front of the screen
cut to a side-shot of an ear
the notes one-by one bounce off of the ear and get sucked into the ear
camera then follows straight into the ear cannal which is black, but then fades into pink
white metaballs fly around on the pink background
a big white ball then forms in the background, and the metaballs slowly fade to pink
the big white ball then shatters into loads of white triangles as the background fades from pink to black
the 3 notes fly out of the explosion and past the screen
quickly scroll thanks on background with a flaming note
